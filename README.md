# Basics_of_linear_regression
This notebook develop mainly for prediction of car prices using Linear Regression Models. 
Here I comapared all features of car with price which is helped me to find coefficient of corelation between them.
After that I created models and trained them on training data.
and used a trained model for prediction of price.
At the end I Concluded result or performence of models for used data.
